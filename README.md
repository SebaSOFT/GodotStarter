# Godot Template Starter

This package pretends to be a startup point on how to structure projects using the Godot Game engine

----

> *NOTE:* This project structure is based (losely) in the proposals of the [Official Documentation](http://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/project_setup/project_organization.html) on project structure and the [Assets Naming Convention](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Assets_Naming_Convention) from Unreal Engine to create a comprehensive set of folders. 
> The premise is always: **GROUPING ASSETS BY USAGE, NOT BY TYPE** since the latter one doesn't scale on big projects.
